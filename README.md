# \# Tax Anomaly Detection in Nigeria’s Economic and Fiscal Data

# 

# This project applies multiple anomaly detection algorithms to identify irregular patterns in Nigeria’s tax and macroeconomic indicators such as VAT, Petroleum Profits Tax, and GDP sectors. It also investigates whether these anomalies align with election periods.

# 

# \## Objectives

# \- Clean and prepare fiscal and economic datasets.

# \- Reduce skewness and multicollinearity using log transforms and PCA.

# \- Apply and compare multiple anomaly detection algorithms.

# \- Combine results through consensus voting.

# \- Analyze anomaly trends relative to election periods.

# 

# \## Folder Structure

# \- `data/` – raw and processed datasets

# \- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for each analysis stage

# \- `src/` – Python scripts for reproducible modules

# \- `outputs/` – charts, tables, and final reports

#
